# TripEasy

A Cross-platform application for trip and holiday planning with AI

## Goal

To create an exciting organizer web application along with Artificial-Intelligence (AI) to be specific model to help users or clients suggest most-effective and efficient travel itineraries. One of the other aims is to improve travel arrangement process, efficient route selection and map users with real-time data of flights.

## Installation

To get Expo Go, follow this [link](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/). Download the app if you want to test the app via mobile.

To make commits, clone the git via git bash or use Visual Studio Code \
https://git-scm.com/downloads \
https://code.visualstudio.com/

Also, to configure your credentials in git, refer to this \
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42318673/changing-the-git-user-inside-visual-studio-code

You may install the Expo Go extensions in Visual Studio Code to use `npx`

Also install node.js to do `npm` commands https://nodejs.org/en/

Do not forget to `npm install` and `npm audit fix` after cloning and pulling!

`npx expo start` is the command to start the app.

If you cannot connect your device to expo go, try doing `npx expo start --clear` to clear cache and make sure the WI-FI is the same for both the debug phone and the computer with VS Code

If it still does not work, try tunneling it with `npx expo start --tunnel`

This app uses Firebase, so create a user login with your email.

~**Update:* Since Express is now being used with Axios, the Express server must be started seperately. To do this,~

~The user must create another terminal instance in VS Code, this can be done by right clicking on server.js and click on `Open in Intergrated Terminal`.~

~After that, run `node server.js` to start the server. Then open the app normally. The server runs on port 3000.~

~*Don't forget to `npm install` as always!*~

**Update 2:* This is now done directly through the code, server.js will remain defunct
